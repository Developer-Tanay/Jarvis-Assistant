If you're not familiar with server management, it's recommended to seek guidance from online tutorials or Minecraft communities.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that MCP is an older version of Minecraft, and it's recommended to use the latest version of Minecraft for the best experience."

        "content": "I apologize for the confusion! Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol used for communication between AI models and their environments. To create an MCP server, you would need to implement the protocol on your server-side application.\n\nHere are the general steps to create an MCP server:\n\n1. **Choose a programming language**: Select a programming language that supports TCP/IP socket programming, such as Python, Java, or C++.\n2. **Implement the MCP protocol**: Write code to implement the MCP protocol, which involves defining message formats, handling requests and responses, and managing connections.\n3. **Set up a socket server**: Create a socket server that listens for incoming connections from AI models.\n4. **Handle incoming requests**: Write code to handle incoming requests from AI models, such as processing queries, retrieving data, or performing computations.\n5. **Respond to requests**: Send responses back to the AI models, following the MCP protocol.\n\nPlease note that creating an MCP server requires expertise in programming, networking, and AI model integration. If you're new to MCP, I recommend consulting the official documentation and seeking guidance from experts in the field.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about implementing an MCP server, feel free to ask!"
